<h1 align="center">Genshi Impact video-game wiki bot!</h1> I created this bot just because the other one didn't work for me lol
<h3 align="center">To use this locally you will need to npm install discord.js and genshin-impact-api</h3>
In the future it will be translated to other languages (if it becomes popular)
Bot uses unofficial 'API' that can be found here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/genshin-impact-api
There are currently two available commands:
char - shows detailed info about an in-game charachter with images and wiki links
map - shows an image of specified map (enemies, shrines, etc.) with a link to a web interactive map
