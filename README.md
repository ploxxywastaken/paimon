<h1 align="center">very outdated recommended not to use Genshi Impact video-game wiki bot!</h1> I created this bot just because the other one didn't work for me lol
<h3 align="center">To use this bot you will need:</h3>
<ol><li>npm install discord.js and genshin-impact-api</li>
  <li>create a discord application and add bot there</li>
  <li>change bot token in index.js</li>
  <li>add bot to your server</li></ol>
<h3 align="center>In the future it will be translated to other languages (if it becomes popular)
There are currently two available commands:
char - shows detailed info about an in-game charachter with images and wiki links
map - shows an image of specified map (enemies, shrines, etc.) with a link to a web interactive map</h3>
